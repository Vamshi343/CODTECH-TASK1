TASK ONE: PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE WITH BACKEND

Create a personal portfolio website with a backend to manage content. This
project helps you learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework like
Express.js or Flask. Design a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Create a backend to manage projects and blog posts.



Portfolio Website
Overview
This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, which showcases my projects, blogs, and other technical works. The website includes sections for displaying different projects and blog posts that I have worked on and written about. It is built with a combination of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js.

The main objective of this portfolio website is to present my skills, projects, and blog articles in an organized and visually appealing manner. This website will serve as a platform to demonstrate my technical abilities to potential employers or collaborators.

Features
Dynamic Projects Section: The website dynamically fetches and displays projects from a MongoDB database, allowing you to add, update, or remove projects easily.

Blogs Section: A separate section to display blogs, where users can read posts about various technical topics, tutorials, and insights. This section also pulls data from a MongoDB database.

Backend with Node.js and Express: The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, allowing for seamless API interactions and database connections for managing projects and blogs.

Frontend with React.js: The frontend of the website is built using React.js to offer a dynamic, responsive, and modern user experience.

MongoDB Database: The data for projects and blogs are stored in a MongoDB database. This allows easy management and manipulation of data.

RESTful API: The application exposes RESTful APIs to manage projects and blogs, including functionalities like GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT operations.

Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
Backend:
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime to run the backend server.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js to handle API routing.
Database:
MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store blog and project data.
Installation
Prerequisites
Before running the project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (Visit the official website and download the latest version)
MongoDB (You can either install MongoDB locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
Git (If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from the official Git website)
Steps to Run Locally
Clone the repository: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory: Once the repository is cloned, open the project folder in your code editor or terminal.

Install dependencies: For both frontend and backend, make sure to install the required dependencies.

Set up MongoDB: If you're using a local MongoDB setup, ensure it's running. Alternatively, you can set up a cloud-based MongoDB service (like MongoDB Atlas). Create a database named portfolio and collections for projects and blogs if they do not exist.

Start the server: Run the backend server by executing the appropriate command to start your Node.js application.

Start the frontend: Run the frontend server by executing the necessary command to start your React application.

Access the website: Once both the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the website.
